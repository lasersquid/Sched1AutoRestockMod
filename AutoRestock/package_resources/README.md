# AutoRestock

If you're tired of spending all your time restocking shelves and stations, this mod will automatically restock empty slots and charge your cash balance or bank account. A spiritual successor to Reshelves (RIP). Configurable through any mod management mod. 


## Features
 - Detects when a slot has just become empty and refills it up to the stack limit or station limit.
 - Works on stations and shelves.
 - Charges your cash balance or bank account.
 - Restocks ingredients, packaging, seeds, soil, soil additives, and consumables.
 - Won't refill items like product, tools, weapons, etc.
 - Refill mixing stations when the mixer quantity is less than the mixing threshold.
 - Configure whether player-initiated actions (start mixing station, etc) will trigger a restock. 
 - Sends a text message receipt at the start of every new day.
 - Saves in-progress transactions when you save the game, ensuring slots are refilled when you reload.

NOTE: This mod will not restock shelves/safe when the player removes the last item. This is because if it did restock, you'd never be able to remove items from the shelf :)


## Configuration

Configurable through any mod management mod (phone apps, etc). Or, you can edit AutoRestock.cfg in Schedule I's UserData directory with any text editor (eg, Notepad).
